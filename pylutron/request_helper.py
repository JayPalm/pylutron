    """A class to help with sending queries to the controller and waiting for
    responses.

    It is a wrapper used to help with executing a user action
    and then waiting for an event when that action completes.

    The user calls request() and gets back a threading.Event on which they then
    wait.

    If multiple clients of a lutron object (say an Output) want to get a status
    update on the current brightness (output level), we don't want to spam the
    controller with (near)identical requests. So, if a request is pending, we
    just enqueue another waiter on the pending request and return a new Event
    object. All waiters will be woken up when the reply is received and the
    wait list is cleared.

    NOTE: Only the first enqueued action is executed as the assumption is that the
    queries will be identical in nature.
